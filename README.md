# Class Based Boss Fight

This is a text based game using buttons on a GUI to make decisions. The
player will be prompted to make choices which will play a
role in their eventual success or demise. Ultimately, the goal of the project
was to focus on good programming practices such as robust testing, a care for coupling
and cohesion, and much more. Although the game is simple, I believe that the character
creation sequence and overall code is implemented rather well.

## Usage

Run GraphicGame.main() from the GraphicGame class in the UI package. If player.txt exists in data,
this will load a previous character and send you right into battle. If there is no player.txt in data,
then you will begin the character creation process. All processes are guided by the buttons on screen once
the class is running.

## Backstory

This project was created with many of the object-oriented programming best practices in mind
I wanted to learn more about the object-oriented fundamentals, while also producing code that
was well structured and tested. I used the shell of a simple game to accomplish this goal.

## Developed Skills

Throughout the creation of this project, I
1. expanded my knowledge in Java coding
2. practiced writing code that adheres to coupling, cohesion, testing, and other programming expectations
3. utilized polymorphism and inheritance for practice at the core of my project
